# README  
This repository contains Python code for the Cost OptimisatioN Framework for Implementing blue-Green infrastructURE (CONFIGURE) version 1.0. 
CONFIGURE integrates a multiobjective optimisation algorithm (NSGA-II) with a hydrodynamic flood model to optimise the BGI intervention cost for the given decision variables i.e., the locations of BGI features. 
Users can follow the instructions given inside the code to integrate their models and related inputs. Details of this framework can be found in the article 
**_CONFIGURE: An Optimisation Framework for the Cost-Effective Spatial Configuration of Blue-Green Infrastructure_**. 
Currently, the article is in the process of publication.     
  
  The framework is developed by Asid Ur Rehman as part of his PhD study at Newcastle University.
